Scaled Up Web Infrastructure for www.foobar.com

Infrastructure Components:
- 2 Load Balancers (HAProxy), configured in a cluster for High Availability
- Web Server (Nginx) on its own server
- Application Server (e.g., Gunicorn) on a separate server
- Database Server (MySQL) isolated on its own server
- Monitoring Clients installed on all servers

Justification for Components:
- Second Load Balancer: Ensures no single point of failure at the traffic entry point
- Splitting components improves performance, fault tolerance, and scalability
- Web server handles HTTP/HTTPS traffic and static files
- App server executes backend application logic
- Database server stores persistent data and reduces risk of overloading other services

Application Server vs Web Server:
- Web Server (e.g., Nginx): Handles incoming HTTP(S) requests, serves static files, proxies requests to app server
- Application Server (e.g., Gunicorn): Executes application code, interacts with the database, and returns dynamic responses

This architecture ensures modularity, easier scaling (horizontal or vertical), better fault isolation, and aligns with industry best practices.
