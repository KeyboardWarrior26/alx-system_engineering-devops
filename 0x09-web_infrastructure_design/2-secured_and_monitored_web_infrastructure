- Web Server (Nginx) - Behind Firewall 2
- App Server - Behind Firewall 3
- MySQL Database - Dedicated
- Monitoring clients on all servers (Sumo Logic/Prometheus)
- Firewalls at entry points (3 total)

Security:

- 3 firewalls for isolation and traffic control

Monitoring:
- Monitoring agents installed on each server
- Metrics collected: CPU, RAM, disk, HTTP requests, SQL queries
- Data sent to a centralized system for analysis and alerting
- QPS monitored by filtering web server logs or using exporters
